    Just want your opinion guys, have you ever used a service-worker? 

I mean "Progressive Web Apps" (PWAs), web apps that use service workers.

I have a branch with it, but hesitate to merge it 🤷 

How hard is it to get rid of it later from cache?

Is it downgrading the score of the Performance in Lighthouse 🤔 ?

Because I see the app is loading longer with service-worker, 

nevertheless Lighthouse shows the same results during Page Speed test, 

and it confuses me. Have you some advices?
